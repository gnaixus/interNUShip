Motivation 
Many undergraduates actively seek internship opportunities to gain practical experience, enhance their working knowledge, and improve their employability after graduation. However, with countless hiring boards and job platforms available, students often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of listings, making it challenging to identify internships that truly align with their skills and specialization. This information overload can lead to hours spent looking through internship postings, and often cause students to overlook valuable opportunities, especially from smaller firms that might rely on less mainstream hiring platforms.
Even when students find an internship that interests them, they may struggle to secure it if their skills do not align well with the employer's requirements. This mismatch can result in wasted time and effort on unsuccessful applications, making the search for the right internship both frustrating and inefficient.

Vision
InterNUShip is a web-based application designed to centralize relevant internship opportunities into a single platform while optimizing the matching process between university students and employers.
This application will analyze both the student’s profile which includes their degree, coursework, and skills, and the employers’ requirements. By aligning student’s qualifications with job criteria, it enhances the matching process, increasing students' chances of securing meaningful internships while helping employers identify the most suitable candidates efficiently
Additionally, the platform streamlines the application process by tracking deadlines and submissions, allowing students to manage their applications efficiently. This not only enhances the convenience of applying to all relevant internships but also improves the success rate while minimizing the time and effort spent on unsuitable opportunities.
